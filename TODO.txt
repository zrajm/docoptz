* [0/5] `t/*.t` (Test suite)
** TODO Fix tests in `t/parse.t`
** TODO Test cases making sure that `set -e` works
** TODO Test cases making sure that `set -u` works
** TODO A test case which tests that `. ./docoptz.sh` loads OK
   Also, make sure that the shell options aren't modified during load (e.g.
   `set -e` should not be enabled by during load).
** TODO Each test should be a function (test1...N)
   This to allow random order testing + test can show ID on failure.
* [1/2] `docoptz.html` (Algorithm description)
** DONE Add `docoptz.html` web page (with some description)
   CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 21:07]
** TODO Explain the inner workings of the code better

** [0/1] TESTS
*** TODO Add tests for prefix() function
** TODO Use `set -eu`
** TODO Finish the grammar parsing
** [0/5] FUTURE MILESTONES
*** TODO Multiple invocations of parse, building up a grammar?
*** TODO Allow 'xxx|yyy' (without parentheses) ??
*** TODO Stop using $IN and $GROUP? (if possible)
*** TODO Remove dead code
** [0/0] DONE
** DONE Rename to use .sh or .dash file suffix

   So that programs in other programming languages can coexist in the same
   directory eventually.
* [0/0] `docoptz.pl` (Perl version)
* FINISHED
** [8/8] Use Dashtap test framework
*** DONE Remove tests from `docoptz.sh` source, put in separate directory
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 16:33]
    Right now the tests cases are part of `docoptz.sh`, but that only works
    during (part of the) development process. The tests should be put into
    their own separate directory.
*** DONE Code in `docoptz.sh` should only contain functions
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 20:59]
    After sourcing `docoptz.sh` only new functions should be created, nothing
    else about the shell environment (or options) should be affected.
*** DONE Don't use global `set -e` in `docoptz.sh`
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 21:21]
    Instead added `set -e` to all tests.
*** DONE Include Dashtap as submodule
    CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 02:34]
*** [3/3] Convert test files to Dashtap format
**** DONE Verify that 'function_exists' has right func name in each test file
     CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 18:03]
**** DONE Title should have double quoted arg "..." (not '...')
     CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 20:23]
**** DONE Make sure each `dumpenv` tests creates a tempdir
     CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 20:23]
*** DONE Update README with relevant test instructions
    CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 20:33]
*** DONE Update README with how to use submodules (for Dashtap)
    CLOSED: [2023-12-10 Sun 20:37]
*** DONE Rename variable 'RETVAL' -> 'RC' in test cases
    CLOSED: [2023-12-11 Mon 23:43]
*** DONE Unset 'RC' after it's been used in each test case
