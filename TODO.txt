* [1/3] README
** TODO Describe what docoptz is
** TODO Link to docopt
** DONE License
   CLOSED: [2023-12-04 Mon 14:23]
* TODO Algorithm description
* [0/6] Test suite
** [3/6] Use Dashtap test framework
*** DONE Remove tests from `docoptz.sh` source, put in separate directory
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 16:33]
    Right now the tests cases are part of `docoptz.sh`, but that only works
    during (part of the) development process. The tests should be put into
    their own separate directory.
*** DONE Code in `docoptz.sh` should only contain functions
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 20:59]
    After sourcing `docoptz.sh` only new functions should be created, nothing
    else about the shell environment (or options) should be affected.
*** DONE Don't use global `set -e` in `docoptz.sh`
    CLOSED: [2023-12-09 Sat 21:21]
    Instead added `set -e` to all tests.
*** TODO Include Dashtap as submodule
*** TODO Convert test files to Dashtap format
*** TODO Update README with relevant test instructions
** TODO Test cases making sure that `set -e` works
** TODO Test cases making sure that `set -u` works
** TODO A test case which tests that `. ./docoptz.sh` loads OK
   Also, make sure that the shell options aren't modified during load (e.g.
   `set -e` should not be enabled by during load).
** TODO Check in the modified Dashtap into the fix.sh repo, add tests there
** TODO Break out Dashtap into its own repository, include as submodule
** TODO Dashtap needs to be resilient when shell globals are set
   `set -e` fucked up the `is` output on failure, making it output
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       t/shell-globals.t: 637: return: Illegal number:  e

   Rather than the expected:
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       Failed test '...'
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
** TODO Each test should be a function (test1...N)
   This to allow random order testing + test can show ID on failure.

** [0/1] TESTS
*** TODO Add tests for prefix() function

** TODO Finish the grammar parsing
** [0/5] FUTURE MILESTONES
*** TODO Multiple invocations of parse, building up a grammar?
*** TODO Allow 'xxx|yyy' (without parentheses) ??

*** TODO Remove dead code
** [0/0] DONE
** DONE Rename to use .sh or .dash file suffix
   CLOSED: [2023-12-03 Sun 13:29]
   So that programs in other programming languages can coexist in the same
   directory eventually.
* [0/0] `docoptz.pl` (Perl version)
