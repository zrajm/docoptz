# Docoptz


# Tests

In this commit the tests are state of being transitioned away from the
`docoptz.sh` source itself into their own test directory (where they will run
using [Dashtap]). This is an in-between state where you'll find the tests (in
the old home-brewed format) in the `t-nontap` directory, and you may run them
like so:

    for FILE in t/*.t; do echo "$FILE"; dash "$FILE"; done
